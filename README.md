# Simple Java Calculator

This is a basic Java console application that performs arithmetic operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**. It takes input from the user and loops until the user decides to stop.

---

##  Features

- Supports **+, -, *, /** operations
- Handles division by zero with an error message
- Accepts both uppercase and lowercase confirmations (e.g., "yes", "Y", "1")
- Uses `Scanner` for user input
- Continues to operate in a loop until user chooses to exit

---

##  Concepts Used

- Java `Scanner` class
- `switch-case` for operator handling
- `do-while` loop for repeating the operation
- `charAt(0)` to get the first character of operator input
- String comparison with `.equals()`
